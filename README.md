This is a small Spider Program which use BFS (Breadth-first search) algorithm to fetch article or key words from the Internet. It uses Jsoup as a HTML Parser. It also provides a layer's label to track each page's "distance" from the starting page.

Still in Developing currently.

Note: You may need to download <a href="https://jsoup.org/download">jsoup.jar</a> before using this code.

Output should like this:
